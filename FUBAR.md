Alice has a restaurant and asks woody to dispose of the trash on thanksgiving day. They dance and since and have a great time and everyone goes home happy. Until the next day ... when Alice has disappeared!

Alice? Alice? Where the feck is Alice?  Bob and Carol have spent the entire time gossiping about where the feck Alice went off to. Much speculation that she's been abducted by aliens.

Ted: Alice? But Alice hasn't worked here in 30 years... that's because she was abducted by ALIENS and they just returned her to Earth.  But Bob and Carol think they JUST SAW HER ... now all them speculate that not only are there aliens, but there's also been a rip in the space time continuum and time is now folding in on itself.

Ted leaves the room unnoticed and goes to the trunk of his car.  He convinces himself
that hes doing the right thing.  "This is what the group wanted!!!" he yells to himself.  He
grabs duct tape, his axe, and a large plastic bag and methodically puts on his gloves and mask...
