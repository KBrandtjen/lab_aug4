Alice has a restaurant and asks woody to dispose of the trash on thanksgiving day. They dance and since and have a great time and everyone goes home happy. Until the next day ... when Alice has disappeared!

Alice? Alice? Where the feck is Alice?  Bob and Carol have spent the entire time gossiping about where the feck Alice went off to. Much speculation that she's been abducted by aliens.

I'm tired of Alice not pulling her weight. She's lazy and incompetent and has been holding us back for years. I think if we get rid of her our team will really shine!! What do you think? Fire her?

Ted leaves the room unnoticed and goes to the trunk of his car.  He convinces himself
that hes doing the right thing.  "This is what the group wanted!!!" he yells to himself.  He
grabs duct tape, his axe, and a large plastic bag and methodically puts on his gloves and mask...
